## NOAA Affiliated Project Listing

Below is a list of NOAA Affiliated GitHub organizations with a link and brief description. More information on their repositories can be found in the README files of each page.

### [Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL)](https://github.com/NOAA-PMEL)

NOAA/PMEL conducts research to advance our knowledge of the global ocean and its interactions with the earth, atmosphere and ecosystems.

### [Chemical Sciences Division (CSD)](https://github.com/NOAA-CSD)

The mission of the NOAA ESRL Chemical Sciences Division (CSD) is to advance scientific understanding of three major environmental and societal issues of our time: climate, air quality, and the stratospheric ozone layer through atmospheric research on the chemical and related physical processes that affect Earth’s atmospheric composition. Our vision is a nation that has the needed scientific understanding and information about our atmosphere (environmental intelligence) to make optimal decisions in the interests of the well being of current and future generations.

### [Global Systems Division (GSD)](https://github.com/NOAA-GSD)

NOAA's Global Systems Division (GSD) of the Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) is a leader in the applied research, directed development, and technology transfer of environmental data, products, and services that enhance environmental understanding with the outcome of supporting commerce, protecting life and property, and promoting a scientifically literate public.

### [Environmental Modeling Center (EMC)](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC)

The fundamental mission of the NCEP/NWS Environmental Modeling Center (EMC), in close collaboration with our partners and stakeholders, is to maintain, enhance and transition-to-operations advanced numerical guidance systems for the Nation's weather/water/climate enterprise and the global community for the protection of life/property and the enhancement of the economy.

### [Physical Sciences Division (PSD)](https://github.com/NOAA-PSD)

The [NOAA ESRL Physical Sciences Division](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd) (PSD) conducts scientific research to observe, understand, model, predict and forecast weather, water and climate extremes and their impacts.

### [NOAA Emergency Response Division (ERD)](https://github.com/NOAA-ORR-ERD)

NOAA ERD Provides scientific and technical support to prepare for and respond to oil and chemical releases.

### [Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL)](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL)

GFDL's mission is to advance scientific understanding of climate and its natural and anthropogenic variations and impacts, and improve NOAA's predictive capabilities, through the development and use of world-leading computer models of the Earth System.

### [Ecosystem Dynamics and Assessment Branch (EDAB)](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB)

NOAA's Ecosystem Dynamics and Assessment Branch (EDAB) of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center's (NEFSC) is dedicated to providing scientific guidance and tools to facilitate Ecosystem-based Management (EBM) for the Northeastern United States. EDAB provide basic information on fundamental ecological properties of the system to the broad spectrum of stakeholders that are engaged in the discussion of policy alternatives to meet the needs for EBM in the region.

### [Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML)](https://github.com/NOAA-AOML)

AOML is a federal research laboratory within NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) with diverse research programs in ocean sciences. Its divisions include Hurricane Research, Ocean Chemistry and Ecosystems, and Physical Oceanography.

### [Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL)](https://github.com/NOAA-GLERL)

NOAA/GLERL conducts research to advance observation, modeling, understanding, and prediction of the Great Lakes.

### [Office of Coast Survey (OCS)](https://github.com/noaa-ocs)

NOAA [Office of Coast Survey](https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov) is the nation's nautical chartmaker and maintainer of the national bathymetry. Originally formed by President Thomas Jefferson in 1807, Coast Survey is the hub for marine navigational information in the United States through chart updates, coastal seafloor surveys, maritime emergency response, and modeled oceanography to support operational tools.

### [NMFS Fish and Fisheries Tools](https://nmfs-fish-tools.github.io/)
The NMFS Fish and Fisheries Toolbox (Fish-Tools) is a collection of software programs and modeling tools which can be used in fishery stock assessments. Many of the models are used in peer-reviewed stock assessments in the U.S. and globally. A variety of fisheries stock assessment models as well as analytical and reporting tools are available, each of which uses a different type of estimation method to produce results. The NOAA Fish and Fisheries Toolbox (Fish-Tools) is part of the [NOAA Fisheries Integrated Toolbox (FIT)](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.github.io/) and is an expansion and update to the NOAA Fisheries Toolbox (NFT)

### [Meteorological Development Laboratory (MDL)](https://github.com/NOAA-MDL)

NOAA/NWS [Meteorological Development Laboratory (MDL)](https://www.weather.gov/mdl) develops and transitions interpretive model guidance, decision support applications and digital forecast services that enable NWS forecasters and partners to be more effective in protecting life and property and enhancing the national economy.  The Laboratory is composed of four branches which develop and produce scientific techniques and technological tools which better enable forecasters to make accurate predictions and better disseminate information about weather, water, and climate effects to the general public. MDL is focusing its efforts through projects including: integration of global models to create consistent forecast products with probabilistic information (National Blend of Models), improved tools for project management and collaboration (V-Lab),  and interaction between forecasters and users (Impacts Catalog). The lab also aims to continue the production and verification of high-quality environmental models and deterministic and probabilistic forecast products (Statistical Post Processing, NDFD, Storm Surge). 

### [NOAA Fisheries Office of Science and Technology Fisheries Statistics Division (OST-ST1)](https://github.com/NOAA-Fisheries-OST-ST1)
NOAA Fisheries OST ST1 (https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/office-science-and-technology) collects data and coordinates information and research programs to support science-based stewardship of the nation’s living marine resources.  ST1 disseminates state and federal statistics about marine fisheries, designs and administers recreational fisheries surveys, and coordinates the Marine Recreational Information Program.
